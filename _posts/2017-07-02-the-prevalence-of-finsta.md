When Facebook first introduced Timelines to replace the original profile page, users gained the ability to easily skip through the years and look over their personal post histories from the moment their accounts were created. If you were like me, who made a Facebook in the tween years, this feature was a nightmare. All of your embarassing (and sometimes problematic) posts and prepubescent pictures were now only a few clicks away. All those insightful and witty thoughts that you deemed worthy to grace your Facebook wall don't seem so wise or funny now, in retrospect. The cringe and disbelief - did I <i>really</i> write that? - became very familiar feelings as I stumbled down memory lane.

I had the misfortune of becoming a tween right in between the death of MySpace and the rise of Facebook. Of course, I had made an equally embarrassing MySpace profile (as well as a Xanga, wow), but that disappeared within the depths of the Internet within time. Facebook, unfortunately, has been here to stay. As privacy settings became more sophisticated, I made sure to comb through my profile and set everything even remotely embarassing to private - viewable only to me. 

By the time I was done, I was more or less satisfied with my online image. And that's the beauty of social media - the ability to present an immaculate representation of who you are. Never mind all the flaws and worries and anxieties that you have and deal with; with a few clicks and some carefully chosen photos, nobody else has to know about them. All they see is the good side of you.

Which, of course, leads to some very toxic environments. There are plenty of studies that link <a href="http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2017.1b16">social media usage with depression and anxiety</a>, and as an avid social media user myself, I can relate. You see other people traveling all over the place and having so much fun, and you naturally wonder why your mundane life doesn't live up to that. Rationally, you have to realize that you're only seeing their highlights and not the rest of their equally boring daily routines, but emotions don't always play well with logic.

All that aside, I thought the natural human tendency was to present the best version of themselves online. That belief was shook by this sudden rise in popularity of "finstas," or fake Instagrams. 

I first learned what finstas were last fall, as I started my first year of college. Now, as I enter my second year, I am finding the finstas of people before I find their actual Instagrams, which I find mindboggling. For those unfamiliar with what finstas are, they are separate Instagram accounts dedicated to posting all the embarassing, ratchet, "behind the scenes" pictures that don't make the cut for your normal Instagram account. Finstas are pretty easy to spot due to their privacy settings and username styles. I have to applaud the creativity of some of my friends' creations, but the purpose of them still confuse me. They exist specifically to display everything that you wouldn't want to show on social media - why?

After some thought, I realized that it has become very popular to be flawed. Every other meme on my news feed is about some negative trait or experience - constantly being late, being a bad student, never having money in the bank account, etc etc. My train of thought is getting derailed as I realize that it's really difficult to come up with insights and write something intelligent about it, but my conclusion is that the landscape of social media is changing for the better. I am constantly reminded now that I'm not the only one with these worries and flaws. I think as silly finstas are, they make people relatable, and that brings people together.

If for some reason you got to here, then I congratulate you for reading through that garbage. Or maybe you skipped all of it and you're just reading this instead, hoping there is a TL;DR. These are mostly an exercise to get my thoughts onto paper and hopefully develop my critical thinking and writing skills, so if you have any sort of constructive criticism or you just want to chat, feel free to contact me!
